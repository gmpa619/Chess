    <h1>How it Works?</h1>
    <p class="HIW">Keep in mind which Chessbase courses you are interested in from the Chessbase DVD's section, send a mail to the mentioned email address max0922941@outlook.com
with the name of the course you are interested in, along with payment confirmation, if the course you are interested in is one of the most popular,
you will receive a link to download the proper course, if not, we will have to update that course that we already have into the shared drive
and it may take a bit longer, but you will receive your mail throughout the day or the next day tops.
Same way for the other chess videos, each section will have it's preview on how it works
